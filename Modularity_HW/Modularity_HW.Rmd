## Abstract

## Introduction

- Can we see climate warming for ourselves by analyzing this data?  
- In what parts of the country are temperatures getting warmer? Are there any parts that actually got colder over 1950-2010?  
- Can we say, based on these data, what change has occurred in precipitation over the period?
