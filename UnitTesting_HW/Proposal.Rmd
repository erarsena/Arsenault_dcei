## The dataset

Looking at an old data set of Jim's

He determined several different hydrogeomorpholoical zones (FPZs) of the Missisippi River and collected mussels and fish from each of these sites
  
## The question

How does food chain length (FCL) vary with ecosystem size?
  Calculate baseline primary producer d15N signature
  Use that to calculate trophic positions for each individual fish
  Use that to find maximum trophic position (FCL) at each site
