<!--Chunk for importing the data-->
```{r import, echo=F}
muss <- read.csv("muss.csv", header = T) #primary producer signature data (mussels)
fish <- read.csv("fish.csv", header = T) #fish consumer richness, length, mass, and isotope data
```

<!--Chunk for cleaning up the data-->
remove NA vals from isotope data, but need those data for richness/abundance still (or not, since richness was not accurately sampled anyways)

## **Abstract**

## **Introduction**

Looking at an old data set from the Mississippi River, POC study but never analyzed

They determined several different hydrogeomorpholoical zones (FPZs) of the Missisippi River and collected mussels and fish from each of these sites

Want to understand effects of FPZ on species richness, food chain length, food web structure (Layman's metrics)
How does food chain length (FCL) vary with ecosystem size?
  Calculate baseline primary producer d15N signature
  Use that to calculate trophic positions for each individual fish
  Use that to find maximum trophic position (FCL) at each site
  
<!--Chunk for making a map of the study sites-->
```{r map, echo=F}
#Dependencies: acis.temp and acis.pcpn dataframes

#map <- map(database = "state", region = c("minnesota", "wisconsin", "missouri", "iowa"))
#map <- readOGR("~/Documents/DataCarpentry/Arsenault_dcei/UnitTesting_HW", "cb_2016_us_state_20m")
#shapeData <- readOGR("~/Documents/DataCarpentry/Arsenault_dcei/UnitTesting_HW", "ne_50m_rivers_lake_centerlines")
#plot(map)
#plot(shapeData, add=T, exact=T)
#need to clip to just show US and only mississippi river states

#Output: Tried making a map but wish I could have figured out how to make 1 map with 2016-1950 temperature differences at each weather station
```

## **Methods**

### *Study Sites*

This study was conducted between the months of May and July 2010 in the Upper Mississippi River watershed, from a tributary of its headwaters to its main channel just above its confluence with the Illinois and Missouri Rivers (Figure 1). 

### *Fish and Mussel Collection*

### *Stable Isotope Analysis*

### *Statistical Analysis*

muss <- read.csv("muss.csv", header = T)
fish <- read.csv("fish.csv", header = T)
