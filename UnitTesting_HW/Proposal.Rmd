## The dataset

Looking at an old data set from the Mississippi River, POC study but never analyzed

They determined several different hydrogeomorpholoical zones (FPZs) of the Missisippi River and collected mussels and fish from each of these sites

Want to understand effects of FPZ on species richness, food chain length, food web structure (Layman's metrics)
  
## A question (functions and tests for deadline 1)

How does food chain length (FCL) vary with ecosystem size?
  Calculate baseline primary producer d15N signature
  Use that to calculate trophic positions for each individual fish
  Use that to find maximum trophic position (FCL) at each site
